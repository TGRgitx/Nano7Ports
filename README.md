# Nano7Ports

# What is this project?
This is a project that will contain my ports of various content from nano 6 to nano 7 (there isn't much of it, but there is some)

# How will they be published?
They will be published in releases, just find the theme you like

# If I want to change the theme, what do I need to do?
Use the iPod theme utility and unpack the resources that are present in the source folder (only modified files are located there)
